Welcome to my portfolio website repository! This project marks my first dive into web development. While the website may be basic in design and functionality, it serves as a crucial stepping stone in my journey to mastering web development, as well as brushes my skills in these languages.

## About
This portfolio website showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in a simple yet elegant manner. It reflects not only my technical abilities but also my dedication to learning and improving as a developer. 

## Features
- Clean and minimalist design
- Easy navigation
- Sections for showcasing projects, skills, and contact information, and mainly the most special [GOALS SECTION](https://portfolio-mu-red-54.vercel.app/goals.html)
- Not Fully Responsive (I will keep updating this website ocassioally until it reaches perfection)

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to motivate my self to learn more as well as complete my [goals.html](https://portfolio-mu-red-54.vercel.app/goals.html) . Additionally, it has provided me with valuable hands-on experience in HTML and CSS, allowing me to solidify my understanding of these fundamental web technologies.

## Acknowledgments
